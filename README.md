# 🔐 CryptoChallenges-GIUCTF2025

[Download here](https://github.com/timedust79sniper/CryptoChallenges-GIUCTF2025/releases)

Welcome to the official cryptography category for **GIU-CTF 2025**, crafted and hosted by [Ali Sherif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-sherif-13812b276/).

This repository contains all the original cryptography challenges that appeared in the competition — ranging from beginner puzzles to real-world inspired RSA breaks. Each challenge includes its full context, story, input files, and a structured write-up or README.

> “Crypto done wrong tells you a story.  
> Crypto done right tells you nothing.  
> These challenges tell you... just enough.”
